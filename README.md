# 🎲 Dicee – Random Dice Roller App

**Dicee** is a Flutter-based mobile application that simulates a pair of dice. With each button press, the app rolls the dice and updates the display with new random values. This project is a great way to get hands-on experience with `StatefulWidget`, `setState()`, and UI interactions in Flutter.

## 🎯 Objective

This app is part of my journey into Flutter and Dart, aimed at understanding the building blocks of interactive mobile apps. It introduces essential programming concepts such as widget state, dynamic UI updates, gesture handling, and responsive layouts.

## 🛠️ Features

- Two interactive dice that update on button press  
- Random number generation for dice values (1 to 6)  
- Clean, responsive UI using Flutter's layout widgets  
- Simple and fun user experience suitable for learning interaction-based app development

## 📚 Key Learnings

Through building Dicee, I learned how to:

- 🧱 Use **Stateless and Stateful Widgets**
- 🔄 Implement `setState()` to update the UI dynamically
- 🎨 Modify and manage widget properties (like images and spacing)
- 🖱️ Handle user interactions via **onPressed** callbacks
- 🔢 Generate random numbers to simulate dice rolls
- 📱 Use **Expanded** and **Flexible** to create responsive UI layouts
- 💡 Apply Dart fundamentals: variables, functions, data types, and interpolation
- 🤏 Add simple gesture-based interactivity
